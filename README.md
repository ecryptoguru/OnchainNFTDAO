# AnkitPunks NFT DAO

This Full-stack Dapp has been made using Next.js@12 React framework
For backend Solidity, JS and Openzepelin libraries have been used in Hardhat Development Environment. 
Wallet-connect functioality has also been integrated and 100s of wallets including Metamask, etc can be easily connected to the Dapp.

The DAO is for holders of our NFT Collection - AnkitPunks. From the ETH gained through the sale of the NFTs, a treasury has been built. 

The NFT holders can create and vote on proposals to use that ETH for purchasing other NFTs from an FAKENFT marketplace, and speculate on price. 

üìù Requirements

Anyone who owns a AnkitPunks NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace

Everyone with a AnkitPunks NFT can vote for or against the active proposals

Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal

Voters cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT

If majority of the voters vote in favor of the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase happens automatically from the marketplace

üî© What we will make

First, we will create a basic NFT contract for the AnkitPunks collection so we have something to test with.

Second, for the DAO to be able to purchase NFTs automatically on-chain when a proposal is passed, we need to use an on-chain NFT marketplace. While there exist a lot of on-chain NFT Marketplaces such as Seaport by OpenSea - we will create our own fake little NFT Marketplace that simulates the behavior of a real one to keep things simple and not turn this into a lesson about understanding the Seaport codebase.

Third, we will write a custom smart contract for the DAO itself where proposals can be created, voted upon, and executed on-chain.

Lastly, we will build a simple website using Next.js to allow users to create and vote on proposals.
